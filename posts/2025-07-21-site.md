# This site

This site is compiled using [**Hakyll**](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/).

I used Sass for styling, because I like css with no brackets.

If ever you wish to learn Haskell there is a
really good course on youtube that you can find [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qThX0aoW9YI&list=PLF1Z-APd9zK7usPMx3LGMZEHrECUGodd3).
