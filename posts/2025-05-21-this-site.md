## Building a Static Site with Hakyll and Sass


You might be wondering why to use Haskell to generate a blog.

#### Why?

There is no particular reason. I just wanted to learn Haskell and try to build something with it. Probably building a static website is not the best way to start.

If ever you wish to use this [**site**](https://github.com/iupiew/site) as a template for your own website be aware that it
will be much more efficient to start by learning Haskell from basics. There is a
really good course on youtube that you can find [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qThX0aoW9YI&list=PLF1Z-APd9zK7usPMx3LGMZEHrECUGodd3).

#### What is cool about it?

I also decided to use the actual SASS(not SCSS) for styling! I find it really nice, similar to yaml visually. Probably due to time I spent with JavaScript I hate curly brackets now...

#### This site is generated with [**Hakyll**](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/)

 - resolver: ghc-9.6.6
 - stack --version 3.3.1 
 - hakyll-sass-0.2.4

cheers
