# Building a Static Site with Hakyll and Sass


You might be wondering why to use Haskell to generate a blog.

### Why?

If ever you wish to use this [**site**](https://github.com/iupiew/site) as a template for your own website be aware that it
will be much more efficient to start by learning Haskell from basics. There is a
really good course on youtube that you can find [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qThX0aoW9YI&list=PLF1Z-APd9zK7usPMx3LGMZEHrECUGodd3).

Note that the last 5 letters of the video link starts with God. That is why...

I tried to load this post to AI and asked why but it didn't get it.

### This site is generated with Hakyll!

and it is only tested with:

 - resolver: ghc-9.6.6

 - stack --version 3.3.1 

 - hakyll-sass-0.2.4

make sure to check out the original [**Hakyll**](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) website!

cheers
